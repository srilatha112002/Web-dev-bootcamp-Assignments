	<p>When my engineering started back in 2014, I said to myself that I must explore Computer Science skipping all those monotonous classes of weird professors who themselves don’t have any idea about what they teach,Getting a “back” in the b.tech exams is like a nightmare,The last night study, canteen trips, mugging up the important as per your friend are the best times. United we stand, Divided we fall.
